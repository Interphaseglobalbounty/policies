# npm Business Solution Terms v2.0.0

These terms and the **Quote** sent by _npm_ or presented to _Customer_ on npmjs.com make up an agreement between **npm** and **Customer**.

## Background<a id="Background"></a>

1.  _npm_ develops computer software and services for installing, managing, and sharing **Packages** of computer code and data.

2.  _npm_'s command-line interface, or **CLI**, allows programmers to create, download, and share _Packages_ through online repositories called registries. _npm_ licenses the _CLI_ on _Open-Source Terms_, so anyone can use it free of charge.

3.  _npm_ hosts the world's largest and most-used registry of _Packages_, the **npm Public Registry**. All _Packages_ in the _npm Public Registry_ are public, and anyone can download them.

4.  Most users search and discover _Packages_ in the _npm Public Registry_ through the **npm Website**, <https://www.npmjs.com>. Users also visit the _npm Website_ to create and manage accounts for publishing _Packages_.

5.  _npm_ uses its familiarity and expertise with the _CLI_, _npm Public Registry_, and _npm Website_ to develop and offer software services for sharing _Packages_ privately within organizations, and for performing security analysis of _Packages_ that organizations use.

6.  **npm Orgs** gives organizations access to, and control over, a named space, or **Scope**, for public and private _Packages_ of their own, on the same infrastructure as the _npm Public Registry_.

7.  **npm Enterprise** gives organizations access to their own, private registry, hosted on infrastructure separate from the _npm Public Registry_.

8.  _npm_ publishes **Documentation** for the _CLI_, _npm Orgs_, and _npm Enterprise_ at <https://docs.npmjs.com/>.

9.  This is an agreement for _npm_ to provide either _npm Orgs_ or _npm Enterprise_ for _Customer_, as **Customer's Solution**.
