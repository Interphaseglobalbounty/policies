## npm Enterprise Terms

These npm Enterprise Terms \(version 6.1.0\) and the **Quote** document
or online form referencing them make up an agreement between npm, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation \(**npm**\) and the licensee named on the _Quote_
\(**Licensee**\).

### Background<a id="Background"></a>

1.  _npm_ develops and provides computer software and services \(**npm
Offerings**\) for installing, managing, and sharing packages of computer
code, data, and programs \(**Packages**\). _npm Offerings_ include a
command-line interface \(**CLI**\) for interacting with repositories of
_Packages_ \(each a **Registry**\), a publicly accessible _Registry_
at registry.npmjs.com \(the **Public Registry**\), and a website
interface for interacting with the _Public Registry_ at npmjs.com \(the
**Website**\).

2.  _npm_ also develops software \(**npm Enterprise**\) for hosting a
_Registry_ \(a **Private Registry**\).

### Enterprise Components<a id="Enterprise_Components"></a>

_npm Enterprise_ is made up of:

1.  **npm's Packages**, _Packages_ that _npm_ owns and maintains:

    1.  _Open-Source Packages_ _npm_ publishes to the _Public Registry_

    2.  _Proprietary Packages_ _npm_ publishes to enterprise.npmjs.com,
    an _npm_-operated _Registry_ \(the **Proprietary npm Registry**\)
    for use by _npm Enterprise_ licensees

2.  **Third-Party Packages**, _Packages_ not owned and maintained
by _npm_:

    1.  _Packages_ third parties publish to the _Public Registry_ that
    _npm's Packages_ _Utilize_

    2.  _Packages_ third parties publish to software repositories
    associated with distributions of the Linux operating system \(**Linux
    Distribution Repositories**\), such as Debian package repositories,
    that _npm's Packages_ _Utilize_

    3.  _Packages_ third parties publish in source code form to software
    source code hosting platforms \(**Source Code Hosts**\), such as
    github.com, that _npm's Packages_ _Utilize_

3.  the **License API**, an application programming interface operated
by _npm_ at license.npmjs.com for managing _npm Enterprise_ license keys
\(each a **License Key**\)

### Licenses<a id="Licenses"></a>

_npm_ grants _Licensee_ a nonexclusive license \(the **Software
License**\) to install and use _npm Enterprise_. _npm_ further grants
_Licensee_ a nonexclusive right to use the _Proprietary npm Registry_
and the _License API_ to install, use, and update _npm Enterprise_ \(the
**Services License**\). Both the _Software License_ and the _Services
License_ \(the **Licenses**\) are subject to the other terms of this
agreement, including payment of fees \(**License Fees**\) and number of
seats \(**Seats**\).

### Subscription<a id="Subscription"></a>

If _Licensee_ has not licensed _npm Enterprise_ before and the _Quote_
provides for a free trial, _Licensee_ will pay no _License Fees_, and
have an unlimited number of _Seats_, for the number of calendar days on
the _Quote_ \(the **Free Trial**\). After any _Free Trial_, _Licensee_
shall begin paying _License Fees_. _Licensee_ will have the number of
_Seats_ on the _Quote_ to start. _Licensee_ may increase the number of
_Seats_ as the _Quote_ describes.

### Permitted Use<a id="Permitted_Use"></a>

The _Licenses_ let _Licensee_:

1.  download and install _npm's Packages_ from the _Public Registry_
and _Proprietary npm Registry_

2.  run _npm Enterprise_ to operate a _Private Registry_ \(**Licensee's
Registry**\)

3.  allow as many _Authorized Personnel_ to make requests of _Licensee's
Registry_ in any _Month_ as _Licensee_ has _Seats_ for that _Month_

4.  make a reasonable number of backup copies of _npm's Packages_ to
protect against data loss or inability to access the _Public Registry_
and _Proprietary npm Registry_

### Prohibited Uses<a id="Prohibited_Uses"></a>

The _Licenses_ do not let _Licensee_:

1.  license, sell, or lease _npm Enterprise_ to third parties

2.  facilitate or allow use of _npm Enterprise_ by third parties

3.  exceed the permissions given by licenses for any _Third-Party
Packages_

4.  remove or destroy any marking showing ownership, like a copyright
or trademark notice, from any component of _npm Enterprise_

5.  disable, avoid, or circumvent any security or access restrictions
of _npm Offerings_, or access parts of _npm Offerings_ not intended for
access by _Licensee_

6.  strain infrastructure of _npm Offerings_, such as the _Public
Registry_, _Proprietary npm Registry_, or _License API_ with an
unreasonable volume of requests, or requests that might impose an
unreasonable load on _npm_ IT systems

### Responsibility and Audit<a id="Responsibility_and_Audit"></a>

If any _Authorized Personnel_ breaches any term of the _Licenses_, or if
any third party breaches the terms of the _Licenses_ under _Licensee_'s
direction or with _Licensee_'s help, this agreement will treat that
breach as if committed by _Licensee_ itself. During the _Term_, _npm_
may audit _Licensee_'s compliance with this agreement and the _Licenses_
at most once per calendar year.

### License Key<a id="License_Key"></a>

_npm_ shall give _Licensee_ _Notice_ containing a _License Key_ no later
than the third _Business Day_ after the date of this agreement. Every
_License Key_ is _Confidential Information_ of _npm_.

During the _Term_, _npm_ shall publish documentation for _npm Enterprise_
that enables a computer professional skilled in the installation
and administration of server software on the Linux operating
system to host _Licensee's Registry_ using _npm Enterprise_, and to
configure the features described in [Functionality](#Functionality)
\(**Documentation**\).

### Support<a id="Support"></a>

_npm_ shall provide support during the _Term_ \(**Support Services**\) by
responding to questions and requests for help concerning _npm Enterprise_
from _Authorized Personnel_ via the channels the _Quote_ describes
\(**Support Requests**\). _npm_ shall respond to and prioritize _Support
Requests_ as the _Quote_ describes. In return, _Licensee_ shall pay the
fees for _Support Services_ on the _Quote_, if any \(**Support Fees**\).

### Other Services<a id="Other_Services"></a>

_Licensee_'s use of the _Public Registry_, _Website_, and _npm Offerings_
other than _npm Enterprise_, if any, is governed by the terms for use
of those _npm Offerings_.

### Payment<a id="Payment"></a>

_Licensee_ shall pay _License Fees_ and any _Support Fees_ as the _Quote_
describes. _Licensee_ shall pay _License Fees_ and any _Support Fees_ in

has in _npm Enterprise_, including in any copies _Licensee_ makes, except
those rights expressly granted _Licensee_ under this agreement. _Licensee_
acknowledges _npm_ owns every _Intellectual Property Right_ in _npm's
Packages_ and _npm Enterprise_ overall, and that other _Packages_
available from the _Registry_ remain property of their owners.

#### Licensee Intellectual Property<a id="Licensee_Intellectual_Property"></a>

customers, and may list _Licensee_'s business name and logotype in
promotional materials, such as on the _Website_.

### Confidentiality<a id="Confidentiality"></a>

The parties may exchange confidential information \(**Confidential
Information**\). _Confidential Information_ includes information marked
or identified as confidential and information the other party should
reasonably understand to be confidential in context, including the terms
of this agreement. Each party shall keep _Confidential Information_ of
the other secret with at least the same degree of care it takes with its
own secrets, and never less than reasonable care. Neither party shall
disclose _Confidential Information_ to any third party, other than to
their officers, directors, employees, attorneys, and accountants, or
as required by law. This agreement does not limit either party's use of
information learned outside any confidential relationship, independently
developed by or for it, acquired from a third party it didn't know was
required to keep it confidential, or become public other than by breach
of this agreement. If a party's personnel breach these confidentiality
obligations, this agreement will treat that breach as if committed by
the party itself.

breach-of-contract damages they could not have reasonably foreseen when
entering this agreement.

#### Indemnification by npm<a id="Indemnification_by_npm"></a>

Subject to [Indemnification Exceptions](#Indemnification_Exceptions),

expenses, damages, and costs from any third-party claims, demands,
lawsuits, or other actions alleging that _Licensee_'s use of _npm
Enterprise_ infringes any third-party copyright or trade secret right. To
be indemnified, _Licensee_ must provide _Notice_ of any action as soon
as possible, allow _npm_ to control defense and settlement, and cooperate
with that defense.

#### Indemnification Exceptions<a id="Indemnification_Exceptions"></a>

_npm_ will not indemnify or hold _Licensee_ harmless for any third-party
action based on any of:

1.  use of _npm Enterprise_ in breach of this agreement

2.  use of _npm Enterprise_ as _Licensee_ modified, added to, or combined
it with other software, equipment, or data \(**Licensee Combination**\),
if infringement would not have occurred without _Licensee Combination_

to avoid infringement, or, if neither of those is reasonably possible,
terminate this agreement and refund all _License Fees_ paid by _Licensee_.

#### Indemnification by Licensee<a id="Indemnification_by_Licensee"></a>

_Licensee_ shall indemnify and hold _npm_ harmless for all liability,
expenses, damages, and costs from actions under [Indemnification

agreement by _Licensee_ or content _Licensee_ stores using _npm
Enterprise_.

### General<a id="General"></a>

automatically for consecutive one-year periods, and either party can end
the _Term_ by giving _Notice_ at least 30 calendar days before it would
otherwise renew. When the _Term_ ends, the terms of the _Licenses_ also
end. When the term of any of the _Licenses_ ends, the _Term_ also ends.
